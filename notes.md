# FJ Retreat (Notes)

## Day One

- Preparation of lent starting today 14th February.
- Learnt from Mark Gospel Chapter 18 Kingdom of GOD is in our hands and this is the time of fulfillement.
- Proclaiming the Gospel of God in Chapter 14 and 15, Lent means we need to link and connect life with the Gospel (Energy) of God.
- Jesus came to proclaim the Gospel of God, understand the energy of God and propagate it through his teachings. He saves his people through the gospel and hence we need this energy in our life.
- Jesus had the Ultimate Gospel of God. Gospel means message or rubric, but we can understand it simply as an Energy Force Field (EFF).
- The world became flesh and dwelt amongst us (John 1:14); Jesus consumes the Earth's nourishment and the world responds to this kind understanding of Life as we know it.
- Our lives are renewed by the Grace of God; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ means he embodied these qualities.
- In all the spheres of life the word of God is a must and has an important message for us to understand ranging from infant to senior person in the world.
- If you want good things to happen in life, you need the word of God to happen in a realistic and clear way at all stages.
- Who belongs to God (John 8:47) knows the word of God. When we integrate the energy of God, we know the message of God.
- In this lent season, we should read the 4 gospels and embody the understanding so that it becomes a part of our body, mind and energy systems in a holistic way.
- When we have grievances or uneasiness, we must understand the message of God (Deity) in the right way and that frees up our soul to undertake greater challenges and missions. In our heart, when we judge others, we should nullify this negativity and explore the "Way Of God".
- For every useless word we need to understand the "Karma of useless speech" and this helps us further our understanding of Right Speech and implement it as Right Action within our daily lives, so that trouble is reduced and we can do good actions throughout.
- Word was made flesh and made amongst us. We are actually the product of God's words'; our bodies are a creation of God's spoken power and that enhances our understanding of why we exist and why we are here; aligning us to our true purpose in life.
- The words of the devil, or unskillful speech need to be replaced with Right Speech and that is referenced when Jesus says "You are trying to kill me" which means unskillful speech kills the energy of Jesus within us, because he was an Ultimate Master and had no negativity in him.
- If there's abundant of Life in our HEART, then there is no evil that can touch us. We don't need to complain that nobody is loving me. This helps us do anything even in the midst of sickness and strife.
- John Chapter 10 says "I have come, so you may have life"; Satan or unwholesome speech and action comes to kill the true self, and that causes troublesome events to occur in our life. The solution to this is to make space for God to penetrate our souls and shine light and consciousness onto our everyday workings.
- John 1:14 "The word became flesh and dwelt among us"; Jesus, The Ultimate Master says skillful words and that creates life force within us.
- John 4:7 "The Samaritan woman came and drove the water" which says "give me a drink". Several things are here; the woman had no great life, in our sight and our description she married several times; she came late in the afternoon when everyone was sleeping. This was so that nobody should know that she came to take the water; at that time, Jesus took the water. We all know this Samaritan woman, and we should take her energy out of our systems for systematic understanding of Life as per Jesus Christ. This keeps us sharp and ready for missions in life. When she encountered Jesus, she turned from immoral to moral character. The Samaritan woman is not happy with anything.
- Several people watch too many movies. People watch all sorts of events like intimate moments and God, the watching energy within us, knows that this damages the system because there is desire and that desire causes the "feeling of adultery" to occur within people. This will cause a failure in the ordinary human beings' family lives. The person lives in you and that creates a mesh of problems that get caught up within the human body.
- When you watch pornography, the events happen inside the mind, and you become unified with this. This is not necessarily a problem, but for people with limited understanding of God, they start acting and behaving in ways unwholsome to humanity. Hence, pornography is not recommended for people in a general sense. This is because the character and vision of life becomes sense riddled with the events in porn.
- 1 Samuel 16:7 "For your adornment should not be external one". The manner and standard of external life should not be an indicator of how close we are to God.
- Matthews 6:24 "The cause of all evil is the desire for money"; When we have greed within us, we don't see the true nature of God.
- Being rooted in Jesus means being grounded in the love for Jesus Christ which involves peace, love, gratitude and kindness.
- Linking the life with the word of God (Mark 7:70) "when he entrained the crown and entered the house" - do you also fail to understand what I am talking to you? You should surrender it to a higher energy force called God.
- What enters from outside cannot defile a person. Hence Jesus declared all food as clean. What comes out from a person defiles the person. What's coming out from the HEART makes the person good or bad. Food simply enters the body and goes into the sewer. Those who are pure of heart should see GOD.
- Matthew says if you see a brother from the HEART, the heavenly Father should free you. This means that when we see people as one united force, we become free from greed, hatred, and delusion.
- We need to practice the good things in life, then they take deep root; for instance doing it 10-12 times. Bad things or unwholesome activities done 3-4 times becomes a part of you. There is a tendency in each person, where the person turns to the wholesome or unwholesome activities.

## Day Two

- Negative one is constantly doing work. Jesus destroyed the work.
- Son of God was brought to destroy the work of the Devil.
- Romans Chapter 1 21:33; all sins are connected by 1 ungrateful heart.
- You feel importance of the eyes because we have pure consciousness, hence we love the pure gift.
- Teslonian Chapter 21A says will of God (Energy) is for all the have one grateful heart.
- Everyone does not have good job. We should thank The Self (God) for what we have.
- If you fill your mind with evil things and desires of the world, you will not understand freedom from pain and suffering.
- The mind is filled with weeds and seeds, we have to clean it so that we understand the word of God.

## Day Three

- That if you think about God then the evil one won't fill your mind with the evil things or thoughts.
- When you feel heat inside, nothing sees you, outside it's too cold or not, you feel good.
- If you walk outside in the terrible situation, then the situation changes whether it's hot or cold, your mind adapts to the situation.
- In the lent season, keep some money outside in the box to give to the poor and donate to charity like Isha Foundation via Naga Wealth.
- Believe in John (8:12); believe in light of life. Those who follow will not walk in darkness, they will have light of life. Which means when you follow the darkness, God makes the light appear using your mind's illumination.
- When is the meaning of the lent; as we are in the lent time Jesus Master said "do this in memory of me, remember the salvation mystery".
- We need to have the rememberences in life; these rememberences are mindfulness where we understand the special times God has prepared for us which is like our marriage, birth or important days like birth of our children.
- Hebrew (14:16); we all need grace when we step by into the day because we feel sleepy this ensures the grace propels us forward and ensures we need God's presence in the fire of life.
- God was doing fast and pray to get boons from prayers and penances by doing sacrifice hustle paid the price where we "hustle" means work hard, and then we get the "price" the gifts that we get because of our good deeds and benefits.
- The tempter came but Jesus conquered the tempter; which means when we are deviated from the mission, we should invoke the power of MJ (Master Jesus) and get the power of life to complete the mission.
- How Jesus has conquered the tempter; by simply knowing the Spirit of the last time he checked himself and his resolve to know God and resolve the fights.
- When we concentrate on prayer, hearing the word the tempter needs to be conquered.
- Within the soul, when God applies his grace on us he removes the sickness.
- When the house is not clean, you yourself get the trouble because the presence of the Lord does not descend.
- Wash your clothes on time, don't keep stinking clothes because others may get trouble by it as it can disturb the energy body.
- Find time to help God and not gossip.
